# Models of Non-Vertical Line

This project was created for a C programming class at Valencia College.
Instead of submitting basic command-line responses, this project mimics 
Visual Basic functionalities using ASCII characters. The system includes
features such as tab indexing, visibility toggles, and button/text classes,
creating an interactive environment for homework assignments.

## Features

- **ASCII-Based UI**: Mimics Visual Basic interface using ASCII characters.
- **Tab Indexing**: Allows navigation through interface elements.
- **Visibility Control**: Toggle visibility of buttons and text classes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implements basic button and text field functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Entry point of the program.
- `ui.c`: Contains functions for the ASCII-based user interface.
- `elements.c`: Manages buttons, text fields, and their behaviors.
- `utils.c`: Utility functions for handling input and rendering.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MikeHodges-IT/models_of_non_vertical_line.git
    ```
2. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    gcc main.c ui.c elements.c utils.c -o models_of_non_vertical_line
    ```
3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./models_of_non_vertical_line
    ```
